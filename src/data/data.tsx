  description: `PhD researcher at Ghent University - Imec, where I am part of the Fixed Internet Architectures & Optical Networks (FARON) research group. I earned my MSc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2019, and my BSc from the Iran University of Science and Technology in 2016.

With a deep passion for software development and research in IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Machine Learning, I bring over seven years of professional experience. My PhD research focuses on Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN) and mmWave MIMO systems, with the goal of leveraging MIMO technology to optimize TSN networks for improved performance. I am involved in several projects, including "SHAPE: Next Generation Wireless Networks" and HPC. I thrive on solving complex industrial challenges and am always eager to learn and adopt new technologies.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, playing video games, cycling, and mountain hikingâ€”activities that help me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.`,
